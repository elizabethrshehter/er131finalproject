    "## Basic Project Requirements (delete this markdown cell in your final submission)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use this notebook**:  This notebook is the template for your semester project.  Each markdown cell provides instructions on what to do in order to complete a successful project.  The cell you're reading right now is the only one you can delete from what you eventually hand in.  For the other cells:\n",
    "1. You may replace the instructions in each cell with your own work but do not edit the cell titles (with the exception of the project title, above).  \n",
    "2. Follow the instructions in each section carefully.  For some sections you will enter only markdown text in the existing cells. For other sections, you'll accompany the markdown cells with additional code cells, and perhaps more markdown, before moving on to the next section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading**.  You'll see point allocations listed in each of the section titles below.  In addition, there are other categories for points: \n",
    "1. Visualization (10 points).  Plots should be well organized, legible, labelled, and well-suited for the question they are being used to answer or explore.  \n",
    "2. Clarity (5 points). Note that clarity also supports points elsewhere, because if we can't understand what you're explaining, we'll assume you didn't understand what you were doing and give points accordingly!  \n",
    "\n",
    "For each Section or Category, we will give points according to the following percentage scale:\n",
    "1. More than 90%:  work that is free of anything but superficial mistakes, and demonstrates creativity and / or a very deep understanding of what you are doing.\n",
    "2. 80-90%: work without fundamental errors and demonstrates a basic understanding of what you're doing.\n",
    "3. 60-80%: work with fundamental flaws in the analysis and / or conveys that you do not understand the basics of the work you are trying to do.\n",
    "4. Below 60%: Work that is severely lacking or incomplete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we distinguish *mistakes* from *\"my idea didn't work\"*.  Sometimes you don't know if you can actually do the thing you're trying to do and as you dig in you find that you can't.  That doesn't necessarily mean you made a mistake; it might just mean you needed more information.  We'll still give high marks to ambitious projects that \"fail\" at their stated objective, as long as that objective was clear and you demonstrate an understanding of what you were doing and why it didn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working in groups:**  We have the following requirements:\n",
    "1. Projects must have at least one distinct quantitative question per student in the group.  Questions can and should be related, but they need to require distinct work efforts, and the interpretation and analysis should cover each question in detail.  If you have any doubt about whether your questions are distinct, consult with the instructors.\n",
    "2. We use a sliding data requirements scale, see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data requirements**:  Projects must use data from a minimum of $1+N_s$ different sources, where $N_s$ is the number of students in the group.  You should merge at least two data sets. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice on Project Topics**:  We want you to do a project that relates to energy and environment topics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Selecting a Project**: You have the choice of working on a project for a client or formulating your own project. Client project descriptions can be found in the \"project\" folder on Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggested data sets**: If you choose not to work on a client projets, here are some ideas for data starting points. You can definitely bring your own data to the table!\n",

    "**Dates**:\n",
    "You have the following due dates:\n",
    "1. Thursday, October 3 (as part of homework 4): by this date you'll be expected to have formed groups of 2-3, identified your data sources, and defined a forecasting question. Feel free to use the lab time period in previous weeks to talk to potential group members, and to post on Piazza if you're looking for additional group members. The deliverable will be a question on homework 4 where you provide your group member names, data sources, and forecasting question.\n",
    "1. Tuesday, December 17 (instead of final exam): This is when poster presentations will happen. Your deliverable is one printed poster for your group outlining the background behind your project, the questions explored, your data sources and choice of model, and results and discussion. A more detailed outline of the poster requirements will be posted later in the semester on Github.\n",
    "1. Wednesday, December 18: Your Jupyter notebook and data should be submitted to bCourses (one submission per group). \n",

    "\n",
    "This section is where the rubber meets the road.  In it you must:\n",
    "1. Explore at least 3 prediction modeling approaches, ranging from the simple (e.g. linear regression, KNN) to the complex (e.g. SVM, random forests, Lasso).  \n",
    "2. Motivate all your modeling decisions.  This includes parameter choices (e.g., how many folds in k-fold cross validation, what time window you use for averaging your data) as well as model form (e.g., If you use regression trees, why?  If you include nonlinear features in a regression model, why?). \n",
    "1. Carefully describe your cross validation and model selection process.  You should partition your data into training, testing and *validation* sets.\n",
    "3. Evaluate your models' performance in terms of testing and validation error.  Do you see evidence of bias?  Where do you see evidence of variance? \n",
    "4. Very carefully document your workflow.  We will be reading a lot of projects, so we need you to explain each basic step in your analysis.  \n",
    "5. Seek opportunities to write functions allow you to avoid doing things over and over, and that make your code more succinct and readable. \n"
